Template for the development of an application for the management of sports clubs
=======
This project was developed for the end-of-degree project on web application development (DAW).
The project consists of a platform for the management of a real personal library where different libraries can be created. In each of the libraries you can register all the books you want. For these books you can add notes that you consider.
Another functionality that it includes is, for example, the possibility of registering loans to each book to be able to keep a more exact control of who has the book since when they have it and when it is scheduled to be delivered.
The platform also allows you to view the libraries of other users who have them public and rate them with a like.

In the back end part, PHP 8 has been used with the Laravel 10 framework. MySQL has been used to store the data.
And finally, HTML 5, CSS 3 with Tailwind CSS and Javascript have been used in the front end.
